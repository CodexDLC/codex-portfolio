# 📄 Experience Page Evolution (System Evolution & Heritage)

[⬅️ Back](./README.md) | [🏠 Docs Root](../../README.md)

## 🎯 Concept

**"System Evolution & Heritage"**.
The "Experience/About" page is reimagined as a development log of a complex system.

## 📐 Visual Structure (Layout)

### 1. Split Header

Divided into two functional zones:

* **Left Panel (The Core):**
  * Interactive IDE window.
  * Displays class `Student(SystemArchitect, TechLead)`.
  * Python syntax highlighting.
  * *Metaphor:* Code as the specialist's DNA.

* **Right Panel (System Specs):**
  * Widget with characteristics.
  * HP/Mana replaced by **Skill Level** / **Experience**.
  * Brief bio-summary in system style (uptime, version, os).

### 2. Lower Block (Changelog Terminal)

Infinite log feed displaying the professional path.

* **Format:** Each entry is a "version" (`v0.1`, `v0.2`...).
* **Style:**
  * Monospaced font (Terminal font).
  * Color indication of statuses:
    * `SUCCESS` (Green) — Successful project/job.
    * `DEPLOYED` (Blue) — Release.
    * `LEARNING` (Yellow) — Education/Courses.

## 🧠 Content Logic

### Inheritance

Direct reference in code that current skills are methods overridden from "parent" classes (Architect / TechLead). Shows the base on which the current profile is built.

### Linking

Each log entry in the terminal has a link to the corresponding project in the portfolio or an external resource. This turns "About Me" into a navigation hub for project history.

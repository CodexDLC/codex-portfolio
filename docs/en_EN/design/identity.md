# 📄 Brand Identity & Philosophy

[⬅️ Back](./README.md) | [🏠 Docs Root](../../README.md)

## 1. Name: CodexDLC

The project name is not just a random set of letters, but an encrypted philosophy of a professional journey.

* **Codex:** A reference to ancient manuscripts (a body of knowledge) and the word "Code" (programming). This is the base, the foundation, the knowledge.
* **DLC (Developer’s Life Cycle):**
  * In the gaming industry, DLC (Downloadable Content) is an expansion that extends the original game.
  * In our philosophy, this is a metaphor for constant development. The base skill ("the game") is constantly expanded with new modules ("DLCs"): new languages, frameworks, pet projects.
  * *Developer’s Life Cycle* is the infinite cycle of developing oneself as a specialist.

## 2. Logo & Symbolism

* **Sign:** A stylized monogram combining code brackets `{ }` and an infinity or cycle symbol.
* **Text:** Strict, monospaced font (terminal style), emphasizing the engineering approach.

## 3. Color Palette (The Pythonic Palette)

The colors are not chosen randomly. They are based on the official Python language palette, paying tribute to the developer's main tool, but adapted for modern Dark Mode design.

### Primary Colors

* **Deep Space (Background):** `#1E1E1E` (or `#121212`). A deep dark background, comfortable for the eyes of a programmer used to IDEs. Not pure black, but "soft" dark.
* **Python Blue (Accent 1):** `#306998` (lightened to `#4B8BBE` for web). Symbolizes logic, structure, backend, calmness.
* **Python Gold (Accent 2):** `#FFD43B` (lightened to `#FFE873` for web). Symbolizes insights, solutions, code "magic", creativity.

### Secondary Colors

* **Ghost Gray:** `#808080`. For secondary text, code comments, inactive elements.
* **Terminal Green:** `#4CAF50`. For "Success", "Deployed", "Online" statuses.
* **Error Red:** `#F44336`. For bugs, errors, problem zones (used in "how we fixed it" cases).

## 4. Typography

* **Headings:** *Montserrat* or *Roboto* (Bold). Modern, readable sans-serif.
* **Body Text:** *Inter* or *Open Sans*. Maximum readability.
* **Code & Technical Data:** *JetBrains Mono* or *Fira Code*. Monospaced font with ligatures. This is a key style element — "engineering aesthetics".

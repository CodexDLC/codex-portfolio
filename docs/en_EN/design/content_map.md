# 📄 Content Strategy & Localization

[⬅️ Back](./README.md) | [🏠 Docs Root](../../README.md)

## 1. Internationalization (i18n)

The system supports three languages. Switching is done via a compact selector in the header (e.g., `[ RU | EN | DE ]`).

* **EN (English):** Main technical language. Architecture description, stack, and README in repositories.
* **RU (Russian):** Personal brand. Deep creation stories, project "philosophy", and personal experience.
* **DE (German):** Professional standard for the local German market. Brief, concise facts about projects and mandatory legal part.

## 2. German Legal Requirements

According to German laws (TMG and GDPR/DSGVO), the site must contain:

* **Impressum (Imprint):** Information about the site owner. Must be accessible in 2 clicks from any page.
* **Datenschutz (Privacy Policy):** Description of how data is processed (even if it's just server logs).
* **Feature:** These sections always remain in German (or have a mandatory German version), regardless of the selected site language.

## 3. Project Narrative: "The DLC Formula"

Each project is described by its Life Cycle to show the depth of development:

1. **Phase: Concept:** What problem are we solving.
2. **Phase: Logic (Prototype):** Why a specific backend stack was chosen (Python/Django/FastAPI). Link to `*.codexdlc.dev`.
3. **Phase: Development (Challenges):** What architectural "bugs" were found and fixed.
4. **Phase: Production (Reality):** Where it is deployed, how it works, and link to the final version.

## 4. AI-Passport (SEO for Robots and AI)

So that HR algorithms and search engines understand your value:

* **LocalBusiness/Person Schema:** JSON-LD markup indicating your location (Germany) and key skills (Python Developer).
* **Clean Media:** Text is not baked into diagram images but goes as separate layers or via SVG so it can be indexed.

## 5. Tone of Voice

* **Style:** "Engineering Excellence". Calm, confident, technically literate.
* **Accent:** We don't just write code, we architect solutions.

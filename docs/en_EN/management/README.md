# 📅 Project Management

[🏠 Docs Root](../../README.md)

This section contains project planning, tasks, and roadmap information.

## Contents

*   [🗺️ Roadmap](ROADMAP.md) - High-level project goals and timeline.
*   [✅ Tasks](tasks/README.md) - Specific task breakdowns and tracking.

## Workflow

We use a simple task tracking system:
1.  Define high-level goals in Roadmap.
2.  Break down into specific tasks in `tasks/`.
3.  Track progress via Git commits referencing task IDs (if applicable).
